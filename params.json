But there are some big dots that revert the ghosts beheavour and allows the player to eat them, giving him extra puntuation. A ghost will respawn time after it has been eaten. You can also get extra points by eating fruits.\r\nAs the level increases, the game gets more difficult. The time of the \"blue state\" is shorter and the ghosts become faster.\r\n\r\n## Release\r\n[https://github.com/SimonStoyanov/Ms.Pac-man/releases/tag/1.2](https://github.com/SimonStoyanov/Ms.Pac-man/releases/tag/1.2)\r\n\r\n## Trailer\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=1IqAUqf8Xgc\r\n\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/1IqAUqf8Xgc/0.jpg\" \r\nalt=\"Trailer\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" border=\"10\" /></a>\r\n\r\n### Team\r\nSimon Stoyanov-Code & Managment: https://github.com/SimonStoyanov\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimonStoyanov/Ms.Pac-man/gh-pages/12321698_1246738678688591_997160364059331442_n.jpg)\r\n\r\nGuillem Sunyer-Code & Managment: https://github.com/Guillemsc\r\n\r\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimonStoyanov/Ms.Pac-man/gh-pages/10003449_839362146089451_177422671_n.jpg)\r\n",
